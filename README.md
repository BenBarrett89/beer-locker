# beer-locker
My attempt at the [beer locker tutorial](http://scottksmith.com/blog/2014/05/02/building-restful-apis-with-node/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Node
npm
```

### Installing

I think you can install all the dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

## Running the tests

Currently there are no tests - but I plan to add them!

### End to end tests

No end to end tests

```
Example
```

### Coding style tests

Add some linting or something at some point

```
Example
```

## Deployment

To run the server you can use the following

```
node server.js
```

It will then be available at http://localhost:3000/api

## Built With

### Production
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Server side framework
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Web application framework
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDB object modeling
* [Body Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - Express body parser

### Development
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) - For assertions in testing

## Contributing

I'm planning on completing this tutorial myself, so this isn't really necessary

## Versioning

I don't think I'm going to version this as it is just a tutorial
